# Phase-1-project
Which API data you'll be using and how you'll use it *
I'll use Google Books API to get the records of books.
Book search: Use the API to search for books by keywords, author, title, or ISBN number, and
retrieve metadata such as title, author, publisher, publication date, and description for each
book. You could then display this information on your website to help users find the books
they are looking for.
Book reviews: Use the API to retrieve book reviews and ratings from Google Books, and
display them on your website. You could also allow users to leave their own reviews and
ratings directly on your site, which could be submitted to the Google Books API to contribute
to the overall rating of each book.
Book cover images: Use the API to retrieve book cover images for each book, and display
them on your website to make the browsing experience more visually appealing.
Author information: Use the API to retrieve author information such as biography,
bibliography, and other books by the same author. You could then display this information
on your website to provide users with more context about the books they are interested in.
The core features of your MVP *
Book browsing: Allow users to browse books by category, author, rating, or search keywords,
and display book cover images, titles, and brief descriptions.
Book details: Display more detailed information about each book, including a longer
description, author information, publication details, and reviews/ratings from other users.
User account: Allow users to create an account, save their personal information.
Notifications: Send email notifications to users about order confirmation, shipping status
updates, and new releases or sales based on their interests.
Admin dashboard: Allow the site admin to manage book inventory, add or remove books,
view order history and customer information, and generate reports on sales and customer
behavior.

Challenges you expect to face *
API limitations: Google Books API has usage limitations, such as the number of requests
one can make per day or per second.
User experience: The sites needs to be easy to navigate since users prefer sites which they
can quickly find the books they are looking for.
